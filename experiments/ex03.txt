running projects against randoop tests
some of them are not compiling, we are ignoring them. some of them are failing.

the tests are from randoop 50 of milos works

commons-coll and commons-math and commons-lang are run with Java 7
commons dbcp is from here not github: http://work@cozy.ece.utexas.edu:2002//home/work/projects/apache-commons/commonsdbcp

This experiment is failed. because I used randoop.tgz not autogens-compiled.tgz.
Then I filtered out tests with compile error.
For instance, for commons-math we had only 2 valid tests. However, logs and results are ready.
