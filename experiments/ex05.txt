do the ex03 for evosuite tests which are in 80 directory. We use autogens-compiled.tgz.
Commons-Lang and Commons-Coll use java 7 so they cannot be used in this experiment.
Although commons-math should be OK with java 8, we have problems with it. So we won't use commons-math for now because evosuite need java8.
(actually, we first examined commons-math with evosuite but we got lots of run_errors. according to pit, something is wrong).

right now, only commonsmath and vectorz are running. all others are done. I'm witnessing lots of RUN_ERROR in both of them
