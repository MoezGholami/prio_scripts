ex02:

again run pit against manually written tests for the commits.
this time, we collect all time out information and all tests which time out against a mutation
however, instead of dynamic time budgetting of Pit (which uses a normal distribution)
we limit time to 4 seconds for each test; because it will take too much time (based on the logs of Travis,
too much amount of time is spent for timeout cases)

commons-math and commons-lang are run with Java 7
commons dbcp is from here not github: http://work@cozy.ece.utexas.edu:2002//home/work/projects/apache-commons/commonsdbcp

experiments are performed on istanbul, xps1, xps2 . cowboy is down! damn.
